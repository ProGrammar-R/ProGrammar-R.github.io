      <h2><a name="changelog">Full Changelog</a></h2>
      <h3><time>September 10, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v3.7.0 Added a tool to <a href="customSpawns/">customize monster spawns</a>, which allows you to specify which monsters appear
          on each floor, at what level, and with what frequency. You could fill the tower with a more carefully balanced mix of monsters than
          simply randomizing would result in, or you could fill the tower with nothing but Pickets if you want. Also made some improvements to randomizing
          appearances; the option is still highly unstable, but might last longer before crashing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>August 26, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v3.6.0 Added a simple template selector and movement view mode to <a href="customFloor/">custom floor editor</a>.
          Together, these can allow players to easily view and see how to navigate the various pre-defined floor 1 layouts.
          Corrected a bug that prevented <a href="guide/units/units.html?name=Koh">Koh's stats</a> from being viewable in the encyclopedia using
          the link provided in the unit index. Added a <a href="guide/floors/">floors</a> section to the encyclopedia to help players and commentators
          quickly see which monsters and eggs can be found on particular floors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 29, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v3.5.2 Fixed issue where trap customizations would not load from seed URLs.
          Note that seed URLs with spell randomization on generated prior to this patch will no longer work as expected, as that flag has been
          changed from 'r' to 'R'. Provided that the seed URL doesn't have a checksum, you can manually update this and the seed URL will work
          once again. Fixed a bug where the elements of monster spells would always match the monster's default element.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 26, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v3.5.1 Marked the below option as highly unstable, as it can result in crashes.
        </li>
        <li>v3.5.0 Added option to randomize monster appearances. See tooltip on option for more information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 22, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v3.4.0 Added an option to randomize monster spells. Added an option to allow Koh to push and attempt to pick up all monsters.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 12, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v3.3.0 Added STARS tournament preset, and renamed existing tournament preset. 
          Changed URL structure of <a href="guide/units/">units guide pages</a> to get rid of the need for frames and added page for
          <a href="guide/mechanics/damage.html">damage calculation</a>. Fixed 404 page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 5, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v3.2.1 Added details on <a href="guide/mechanics/stats.html">stat calculation</a> to the guide.
        </li>
        <li>v3.2.0 Added an <a href="guide/">online guide to the game</a>. It primarily has information about units at the moment,
          but it will be expanded over time. Added an option to change or randomize Koh's element. To see which element Koh has
          if you have chosen Random, attack an enemy without using mix-magic or an elemental weapon and observe the color and style
          of explosion produced.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>June 22, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v3.1.0 Added version, seed URL, and timestamp to CUE files generated by the site. If you are submitting a run to the
          leaderboards and don't copy the seed URL at the time of seed generation, just open the CUE file as a text file to retrieve this info.
          Fixed how seed URLs are generated and loaded when a checksum isn't available. Fixed a minor issue with copying/pasting palettes in
          the <a name="customPalettesEditor" href="customPalettes/">custom palettes editor</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>June 9, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v3.0.1 Changing spritesheet no longer changes active colorway if an extra colorway is selected.
        </li>
        <li>v3.0.0 Added support for palettes beyond the four basic palettes in the custom palette editor. These extra palettes are used
          for things like projectiles, effects, dark Pulunpas, etc. This required a changed to the format of custom palettes such that
          old versions are not compatible with the current version of the randomizer. Added support for copying/pasting palettes.
          Added support for viewing additional sprite sheets.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>June 7, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.7.0 (Hopefully) fixed a bug that caused checksum matching to fail. Added a new feature to improve accessibility,
          <a name="customPalettesEditor" href="customPalettes/">an editor to create custom color palettes</a> for monsters in the tower.
          This is especially helpful when using the option "Randomize enemy elements". For a thorough description of the tool,
          open the <a name="customPalettesEditor" href="customPalettes/">custom palettes editor</a> and click "Help".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>June 4, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.6.0-beta3 Fixed bugs with item and trap statuses. Added help page.
        </li>
        <li>v2.6.0-beta2 Waypoints can now be edited in custom floors. Fixed bugs in custom floor generation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>June 3, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.6.0-beta Custom floors are now supported enough for testing in game, as only waypoints are not editable via the GUI.
          To test, go to the <a name="customFloorEditor" href="customFloor/">custom floor editor</a>, import a predefined floor JSON file
          (links in #randomizer on the Discord), then make your changes. When you're done, click "Export file", return to this page,
          then select that file as the custom floor file in the options before clicking Randomize.
        </li>
        <li>v2.6.0-preview7 Custom floor: added support for changing elevators, items, traps, and monsters, though the apply mode does not yet apply these.
          Added packing routine as a proof of concept, but this does not integrate with the randomizer and thus only exports the floor itself.
          Fixed some misnamed tiles which caused some maps to look incorrect.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>May 31, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.6.0-preview6 New option for fixing minor bugs. Added a <a href="guide/bugs.html">page that catalogs all known bugs in the original game</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>May 27, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.6.0-preview5 CustomFloors: Made 'unk' value (seemingly relative height) show on doors.
        </li>
        <li>v2.6.0-preview4 CustomFloors: Made doors take precedence over room tiles, since they seem to actually be more like waypoints for monster AI
          and can appear in the interior of rooms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>May 25, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.6.0-preview2 Added a few more view modes to the custom floor editor, hotkeys A/S for changing between Select and Apply modes,
          support for turning random spawns on and off, and changed color scheme.
        </li>
        <li>v2.6.0-preview1 Added a <a name="customFloorEditor" href="customFloor/">custom floor editor</a>, which is a work in progress.
          You can only edit tiles right now (not items, traps, elevators, or rooms), and the repacking utility needs to be re-written into JS
          and added to the site. It is being released as a preview to gather feedback and gauge interest.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>May 17, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.5.1 Directly modified floor layouts for fast tutorial floor and 2nd floor (when second tower enabled). As a result,
          you'll now actually see the elevator on the first step when fast tutorial floor is enabled. When the second tower is enabled,
          the elevator to the second tower will always be visible on the Ghosh/Selfi floor (before it would only appear if Ghosh appeared).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>May 10, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.5.0 Added option to make trap selection closely match trap options selected. I strongly recommend using this whenever customizing
          frequency because it makes things work as most people would expect. Selecting a trap spawn rate of max will now spawn more traps.
          Fixed another bug around default starter and traps that prevented
          saved preferences from being applied.
        </li>
        <li>v2.4.3 Fixed a bug that prevented Kewne from being the default starter and the default trap settings from being applied.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>May 7, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.4.2 Default options are now omitted from generated URLs.</li>
        <li>v2.4.1 Portable elevators can now be directly triggered by selecting "Use" from the Items menu.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>April 16, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.4.0 Added <a href="gbc/">GBC de-randomizer</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>April 4, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.3.1 Tweaked layout. Added tooltip for traps.</li>
        <li>v2.3.0 The option "Fix some types of crashes" fixes more crashes present in the original game.
          This now includes crashes caused by trying to spawn monsters with level > 99.
          This should fix floor 99 of the second tower and egg-bombing when Koh is level 50+.
        </li>
        <li>Added tooltips to options which are not self-evident. 
        </li>
        <li>Default states of options now match the vanilla game, which should fix issues with sharing certain seeds.
        </li>
        <li>Minor changes: moved full changelog to a separate page, removed tournament explainer, "Safe" present now has fix crashes option turned on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>March 28, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.2.0 Added an option to fix some crashes that are present in the original game. Right now this only includes the crash that occurs when
          gaining too much experience at once (specifically, between 32,767 and 39,480 EXP; higher amounts would only cause graphical glitches).
          This is particularly useful for the second tower and survival modes, where this bug would be encountered more often. The game will still overflow
          the amount of experience earned at once above 65,535 EXP; the text box will still show the pre-overflow value, but the pop-up will now now show
          the actual amount earned.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>March 24, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.1.1 Tweaked items in survival mode: removed blue collar and Harash and Horrey herbs in favor of Flat scroll, Trained wand, and Leather shield.
          If you still want the blue collar, enable the separate option to start with it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>March 18, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.1.0 Added option to start with the blue collar. Added new preset for speedrunning second tower.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>March 10, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.0.2 Added an option to remove limit on the number of items that can brought into tower.
          Enabled seed to be copied before generating file to allow bots to generate seeds. These URLs lack checksums so they are not recommended for
          tournament races. Clarified some option names.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>March 9, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.0.1 Fixed a bug that prevented loading seed URLs that were created from presets. The preset still doesn't show up in the angel's opening text
          for the time being, but at least URLs containing presets can be shared.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>March 8, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v2.0.0 Fixed a bug in the core de-randomizing assembly code that would occasionally cause floors to repeat. This should substantially improve the
          RNG seeding in terms of entropy, especially as nearing floors that are multiples of 32. Since the same seed number will now generate a different tower,
          the major version number has been bumped to reflect this lack of compatibility.
        </li>
        <li>Also added a feature to automatically test system-generated seeds for potential repeated floors and choose a new seed if repeats are found.
          User-provided are not checked, so I recommend allowing the system to fill in the seed field even though these sorts of repeats are statistically much
          less likely.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>February 5, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.18.1 Added warning text about a bug when the 'Preset' checkbox is left checked when generating a seed; this will be removed when the bug is fixed.
          Thanks to LoonyCloud for reporting this bug.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>February 4, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.18.0 Rearranged a few options into the Special items section. Added option to make floor 2 always be the predefined floor with Ghosh and/or Selfi.
          This is primarily intended to let any % runs of the second tower begin the first time you enter the tower if so desired.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>February 1, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.17.0 Added option to enable the second tower and preset Enable Second Tower, which is the vanilla game with just the second tower enabled.
          The second tower is a secret "hard mode" that I discovered, which will now appear as a second elevator to the left on floor 2 (after re-entering the tower).
          I've only made changes to make it accessible and fix a few text-related issues, everything else is as the game designers programmed.
          Also added a Tournament preset (standard settings for a Rock Me to the Top tournament match).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>January 22, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.16.2 Fixed bug where floor 99 on endurance mode would show "40F" when loading into the floor.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>January 19, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.16.1 Fixed bug where portable elevators would cause all balls and some scrolls to function like portable elevators.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>January 12, 2020</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.16.0 Enemy levels in enemizer are now rounded down to better match the original game and improve balance.
          Dragons, Maximums, Golems, and Killers will no longer appear below floor 4 in enemizer to improve balance.
            Added option to spawn portable elevators. These must be triggered by standing on one and selecting "At feet" from the menu,
            selecting the "Give" option, or throwing one at a monster; selecting "Use" will have no effect due to certain limitations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>November 23, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.15.0 Added an option to randomize floor theme (appearance), including five previously unused themes.
          Added an option to allow in-tower saves to be loaded more than once. Removed wind crystals from survival mode.
          Also fixed a bug where enemy monsters elements were always randomized, even with element randomization off.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>November 10, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.14.2 Fixed a crash that occurred in survival mode when entering the tower for the first time with Kewne as your familiar.</li>
        <li>v1.14.1 Tweaked resources in survival mode to replace some stat-restoring herbs with sands.</li>
        <li>v1.14.0 Added survival mode, where the tutorial floor has been replaced with a floor containing a set of many useful items.
          However, items will not spawn in the tower as usual– only coins will appear. Naturally, settings like
          "spawn Barong-only items" and "randomize starting items" will have no effect. This new floor does have an elevator, but it is only visible
          on the minimap.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>November 3, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.13.0 Monsters can now have their elements randomized within a floor, though enemy monster spells may not match their element.
          Fixed the elevator spawn rate on the safe preset to be correct default.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>October 19, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.12.0 Added an option to replace Go Up traps with Go Down traps that send Koh down a floor instead.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>October 13, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.11.2 Fixed a bug where upper bound of enemy spawn rate was never set.</li>
        <li>v1.11.1 Fixed a bug with elevator spawn rate in seeds.</li>
        <li>v1.11.0 Added options for changing elevator and monster spawn rates. Added options to replace tutorial Pulunpa with a Barong
          and to allow Barong-only items to spawn normally. Note that this does not change very rare spawns like Geropita Fruit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>October 6, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.10.0 Refactored how fields are managed. Added support for changing trap spawn rates.
            Be aware individial trap spawn rates are relative and matter less when the overall spawn rate is increased.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>September 15, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.9.0 Added an option for a true boss fight where several things have been changed compared to the original game. Further changes may be made after testers give their opinions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>September 12, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.8.2 Fixed a bug where using endurance mode with time difficulty off would result in very low level monsters; thanks to Vega Sera for reporting this.</li>
        <li>v1.8.1 Fixed a bug where using a seed URL with the new balls option would always enable item randomization.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>September 8, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.8.0 Added time difficulty mode, where monster difficulties increase over time (tracked since game first loads). Options that require another option will now be hidden if the prerequisite isn't met.
            Fixed a bug where "Randomize Barong floors" could be unchecked when using a seed URL. Fixed a bug in the generated URL shown in the angel's text.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>August 27, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.7.4 Added custom domain "adrando.com". Added Sustainna's lovely favicon, which is used with permission (also licensed under MPL 2.0). Embedded full URL seed into angel's text.</li>
        <li>v1.7.3 Fixed bug in original game that meant when randomizing monster elements, Manoevas wouldn't copy palettes of target monsters.
                    Kewne's and Hikewne's elements will no longer be randomized in when selecting enemizer + monster element randomization since they do not change palette when changing element.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>August 25, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.7.2 Removed pause after death to resolve softlocks.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>August 25, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.7.1 Fixed bug that causes 'Copy Seed' to crash tab.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>August 24, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.7.0 Added options to randomize eggs and enemy elements, make tutorial faster, and disable de-randomization.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>August 14, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.6.4 <del>Introduced a pause after Koh dies that players have to press a button to clear, so commentators have an easier way to see what floor a player died on.</del> Removed in v1.7.2</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>August 12, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.6.3 Made endurance mode have three difficulties as defined by the enemy scaling, where "Normal" was the previous version of endurance mode.
        Added option to add new spell balls, which will now only appear as possible starting items in itemizer if this is checked.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>August 9, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.6.2 Fixed URLs generated when pressing "Copy seed", so link sharing should now work. Seed is now embedded into angel's opening text.
        Adjusted help text based on most commonly received questions</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>August 4, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.6.1-beta Added option to randomize spell ball elements. Balls with non-native elements use the name and description of the corresponding spell.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 31, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.6.0-beta Added endurance mode, where tower now has 99 floors. This is somewhat experimental, as very high level enemies can give you too much EXP and cause a crash.
                        Also, while the end now occurs on floor 99, the graphic for that floor still says Floor 40.
                        Seeding had to be slightly adjusted to allow for more than 40 floors to prevent repeated floors.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 28, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.5.5 Fixed bug with intro skip where entering your house would cause the game to freeze. Improved intro skip to bypass another loading screen and movie.</li>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.5.3 Removed Ultimate egg from the itemizer egg pool, due to it <a href="https://gfycat.com/foolhardyflimsyguineapig">instantly disappearing from one's inventory</a> upon getting it.
        Thanks to Baldwin for reporting this.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 19, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.5.2-beta Itemizer can give one more new possible starting ball. Marked as beta because this is implemented a little bit more experimentally, but will allow for more possibilities in the future.</li>
        <li>v1.5.1 Itemizer now actually gives random starting items. Added two otherwise unused balls to the pool of potential starting balls. Thanks to Sand_Knight_ for reporting this.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 18, 2019</time></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>v1.5.0 Tweaked UI. Added option to randomize starting items within item category (suggested by DonForgo and Sand_Knight_). All items will be identified except for the egg (for techincal reasons).
        The egg may not have an associated color, in which case it is the evolved form of a monster.
        All weapons and shields have no modifiers, are uncursed, and all balls will have 5 charges (1 for Acid Rain). Medicinal herb will always be unchanged.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Fixed link to discord.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><time>July 13, 2019</time></h3>

        <li>v1.4.3 Fixed bug when randomizing starter element where initial spell's element would not match starter's new element (if different).</li>
        <li>v1.4.2 Added options to allow hidden spells to be available by default and random starter element (suggested by Sand_Knight_ and Baldwin).</li>

      <ul>
        <li>v1.3.0 Added option to automatically skip most of the otherwise unskippable introductory cutscenes. There is still a lot of loading, but it's a much improved experience for races and practice.</li>
      </ul>
