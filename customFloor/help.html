      <h1>Custom floor help</h1>
      <h2>View mode</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Appearance: shows what each tile looks like. Some tiles may look the same in the editor but have different appearance IDs because
            they incorporate elements that can't be shown in the editor, such as an archway overhead.
          </li>
          <li>Height: colors each tile based on height. Blue is 0; tiles get redder the lower they are, and greener the higher they are.
          </li>
          The following modes all color tiles with a non-empty appearance as dark green, except as specified.
          <li>Rooms: shows rooms in red, with waypoints colored green with a number on them indicating their relative height.
          </li>
          <li>Movement: shows the directions that Koh could move in if standing on the tile in brown. If a tile has a line radiating from its
            center to another tile, then it is possible to move from the first to the second tile. Otherwise, it's not possible to move in that
            direction from the first tile.
          </li>
          <li>Elevators: shows elevators in green.
          </li>
          <li>Items: shows items in blue.
          </li>
          <li>Traps: shows traps in fuchsia.
          </li>
          <li>Monsters: shows monsters in red.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Edit mode</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply: hotkey A. Clicking on a tile will apply the currently specified height, appearance, and tile status to that tile.
          </li>
          <li>Select: hotkey S. Clicking on a tile will fill the height, appearance, and tile status field with that tile's values.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Tile status</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>No tile: tile acts as if no tile was there (it had appearance 0). Used for walls, pillars, etc.
          </li>
          <li>No spawns: random monsters, items, and traps will not spawn here.
          </li>
          <li>Water: tile contains water, so only flying monsters can path over it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Height</h2>
      <div>
        The height of the tile off the ground. This should generally be set in increments of 32.
        The minimum height is -32,768 and maximum height is 32,767.
      </div>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <div>
        What each tile looks like. An appearance of 0 means an empty tile. An appearance of 3 is used around the perimeter of the floor.
        Some tiles may look the same in the editor but have different appearance IDs because
        they incorporate elements that can't be shown in the editor, such as an archway overhead.
      </div>
      <h2>Room</h2>
      <div>
        Rooms must be manually specified so monsters behave accordingly.
            To select a room, click the top-left corner tile (use the "Rooms" view mode to see where that is).
            Generally rooms are specified to start just inside the walls, but the tutoirial floor acts differently.
            Rooms should have associated waypoints set at the entrances and exits and may need intermediates.
            The game supports up to 36 rooms in the same floor.
        <ul>
          <li>Checkbox: check to create a new room with the selected tile as the top-left corner.
            Uncheck to delete the room and any associated waypoints.
          </li>
          <li>xSize: the room's width (along the X axis) in tiles. Must be at least 1.
          </li>
          <li>ySize: the room's length (along the Y axis) in tiles. Must be at least 1.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Waypoint</h2>
      <div>
        Waypoints are used to define entrances and exits of a room, and intermediate points if necessary. Waypoints are used by monster AI.
        <ul>
          <li>Checkbox: check to create a new waypoint; it will automatically be associated with the nearest room. Uncheck to delete the waypoint.
          </li>
          <li>Relative height: A monster will only traverse to waypoints within +/-1 relative height as where it entered.
            As such, set the relative height of all waypoints to 0, except if the following applies.
            To indicate that a waypoint is higher up and can't be reached directly, give it a relative height of 2.
            To indicate that monsters should travel to this waypoint as an intermediate between relative heights of 0 and 2,
            give it a relative height of 1.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Item</h2>
      <div>
        To be described.
        <ul>
          <li>Quality: the +/- on equipment, number of charges on a ball, or the percentage from 100% that an egg has left to warm (e.g. 1 is 99% warm).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Trap</h2>
      <div>
        To be described.
        <ul>
          <li>Level: only available for monster dens. Specifies how many enemies will spawn, max 32.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Import/Export</h2>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Load template: Unless you are working with an existing file, loading a template is highly recommended as your starting point
            to provide some required properties like "firstSector" and "sizeInSectors". Selecting a template will overwrite all existing
            work, so if you have made any changes, be sure to export your file before loading a template.
          </li>
          <li>
            Import file: Listed as "Choose File", this imports a custom floor JSON file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Import text: This replaces the contents of the editor with the contents in the text area, which can be useful if you have made
            a change and want to revert back to the loaded template or imported file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Export text: Outputs the contents of the editor into the text area, which can be useful if you want to be able to quickly
            restore to your current state after testing a few changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Export file: Save your work to a JSON file to either work on later or patch into the game using the randomizer (just select
            your exported file for the "custom floor" option).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
